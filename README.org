* Option Pricing Visualization

This is a personal project that I am running to display some important aspects in option pricing. I will eventually want to have plots for
- Sample Paths from Geometric Brownian Motion
- Pricing Surface
- Greeks

  One of the goals of this project is to be able to see visually how changing some of the parameters will effect the price and the greeks. To do this I am trying to write more object-oriented code which is in contrast to my usual style of just creating functions and using them in a script. To do this I plan on writing classes for Geometric Brownian Motion and the contracts for the options. This should allow for an easier way to change the parameters in a more controlled and observable way to constantly having to write new parameters for different functions.
